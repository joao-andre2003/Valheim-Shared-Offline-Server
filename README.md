# 
A program made for the game Valheim that makes possible multiple players share the same world at any time, without the need of a dedicated server  UNFINISHED YET
# Why use?
If you have a group of friends that you play Valheim with, you must know how annoying it is to be able to play in the world only when the world's owner is online to host. With this program, any player can have the current world save of the owner and host it for other players to join, at any time, independent of the original owner's availability. All the player's progress will be saved and can be loaded by any of the players after. It is basically how an open server works, but cost-free, with quick save and load operations for the shared world save and any player from the server can host.
